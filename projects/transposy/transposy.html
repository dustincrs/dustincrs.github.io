					<p>Recently, I've been getting into making simple music as a hobby. In fact, I even purchased a <a href="https://www.teenageengineering.com/products/po" class="styled-link">pocket operator</a> to tinker around with (though it's more for jamming during commutes etc). I won't describe everything about it it all down for you here, but one of the limitations of the pocket operator I have is that it can't play every single note in the chromatic scale. In fact, if I heard correctly, there is only one note it can't play at all, which is Bb.</p>

                    <p>You can imagine that this would be an inconvenience when making song covers. This inconvenience is made even more annoying because I never learned how to transpose music notes to avoid the  Bb. In fact, I once failed my Grade 1 piano and music theory exam (which I am more proud of than ashamed of), and I consider myself musically illiterate.</p>

                    <p>Not one to be put off by my own limitations, I figured that if I was going to get anywhere with making music on such a limited piece of kit, I would have to be able to transpose notes to avoid the dreaded and inaccessible Bb. I found a random article online that said music transposition is as simple as shifting each note in a melody a certain set number of semitones. Now- I can't actually read musical notation and you can bet I'm not the type to sit down and shift notes one by one anyway, so I figured: if transposition is as easy as this article says it is,  why not whip up something in Python to do the transposition for me? Enter: Transposy- my rudimentary yet functional musical transposing utility. I've already used it several times to great effect and I even added a function in there for my specific predicament: avoiding notes! Now I can just tell transposy to avoid Bb, and I suddenly have every transposition that does not have a Bb in it- ready to be played on my pocket operator.</p>
